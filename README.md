# Getting and Cleaning Data - Project

This repo is to house my project in the Coursera class Getting and Cleaning Data

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

###Files included in this Repo

*Codebook.md - This includes a description of the data that is manipulated including source and explanation. It also provides an overview of the manipulations I used to get the final data set.
*README.md - Overview of this Repo.
*run_analysis.R - this is the script I wrote to save and clean the data. For this script to work in R it assumes you have the dplyr package installed in R and the UCI HAR Dataset is downloaded to your R Working directory. It will produce two text files - tidy_data.txt which is the tidy data set required in step 4 of the assignment, and tidy_data_summarized.txt which is the data set required in step 5 of the assignment. Both will be saved in your R working directory.
*tidy_data_summarized.txt - this is the final data set that summarizes the average of each variable for each activity and each subject as required in step 5 of the assignment.
